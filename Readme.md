This machine learning project aims to classify song data into one of the following 10 genres: Pop-Rock, Electronic, Rap, Jazz, Latin, RnB, International, Country, Reggae and Blues; using 3 main components of music: timbre, pitch (melody and harmony) and rhythm. 

Methods use are Logistic Regression and MPL Neural Network are applied as a classifier using normalized and PCA-transformed data. MPL Neural Network seems to perform better for this dataset, achieved approx. 65% accuracy for cross-validate data as well as Kaggle public and private board. 

Raw data can be found under ./data and final solution can be found under ./Report
